# Sliding-Puzzle-Solver
For this sliding puzzle coursework, I would choose to implement an A* search algorithm paired with a grid-based representation using a graph data structure. The A* algorithm is well-suited for finding the shortest path in a graph with weighted edges, which fits the sliding puzzle scenario. By using a grid-based representation, each cell can represent a possible position on the map, and edges between cells represent possible movements.

The choice of A* is because it efficiently navigates through the puzzle space while guaranteeing the shortest path, provided a consistent heuristic function. The heuristic function can be designed based on Manhattan distance or Euclidean distance between the current position and the goal, providing informed guidance for the search process.

I would implement a simple parser to read the input file and extract necessary information such as the width, height, start and finish positions, and the locations of rocks. This parser would allow for easy integration of different maps and facilitate testing with provided benchmarks or custom scenarios.

In the performance analysis, I would evaluate the efficiency of the A* algorithm based on empirical studies, analyzing factors such as runtime, memory usage, and scalability with different map sizes. Additionally, I would discuss the theoretical considerations of the algorithm's complexity, aiming to provide a Big-O notation classification for its time and space complexity, considering factors like the branching factor and the effectiveness of the heuristic function in guiding the search. Overall, the combination of A* algorithm and grid-based representation is expected to offer a robust solution with efficient performance for solving sliding puzzles.
