# Sliding-Puzzle-Solver
This project utilizes a queue data structure with an ArrayList implementation for efficient manipulation of surrounding nodes. The adjacency list, also implemented using ArrayList, optimizes space and facilitates traversal through neighboring vertices. Employing breadth-first search, the algorithm efficiently determines the shortest path without exhaustive node inspection. Starting from the initial position, adjacent nodes are explored iteratively until the endpoint is reached. The algorithm adapts dynamically to the map's characteristics, efficiently navigating through potential obstacles. Performance analysis involves benchmarking execution times across various input sizes, considering both best and worst-case scenarios to evaluate algorithmic efficiency comprehensively. Overall, the project effectively combines data structures and algorithms to solve sliding puzzles with practical efficiency and adaptability.
